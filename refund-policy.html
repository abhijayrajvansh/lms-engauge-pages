            <p><span class="body-text">
                All sales of courses on the Engauge Learning platform are final. Once you purchase and gain access to any course,
                no refunds will be provided under any circumstances.

            <p><span class="body-text">
                Our courses are digital products that provide immediate access to educational content upon purchase. Once you have
                access to the course materials, videos, and resources, we cannot "take back" the knowledge or content you have
                already accessed. Therefore, all sales are considered final.
